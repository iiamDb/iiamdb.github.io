## Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li> Befor beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the termial (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux)    
</ul>
 <h1>Version Control</h1>
 <ul>
  <li> <em>Version Control</em> is a system that allows you to revisit various of a file or set of files by recoding changes.
</ul>

 ### Different type of *Version Control's*
 <ol>
  <li> <strong>Local Version Control</strong>- A local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files</li>
  <li> <strong>Centralized Version Control</strong>- The need for collaboration withing a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.</li>
  <li> <strong>Distributed Version Control</strong>- This system addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure>
</ol>
<h2> So, what is <em>Git</em>?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.</li>
  <li> Git mostly relies on local operations because most neccessary information can be found in local resources.<li>
  <li> Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.</li>
  <li> Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidently lost data.</li>
  <li> Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.</li>
</ul>
